## Troubleshooting

In case you ran into problem like `/usr/bin/env: node: No such file or directory` when you try to run gulp, this was due to the misnaming convention between nodejs and node. You simply need to run this command to make this error goes away,

```bash
ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
```
according to https://github.com/nodejs/node-v0.x-archive/issues/3911

In case you ran into problem like `require': cannot load such file -- jekyll-sitemap (LoadError)` when you try to run jekyll server, this was due to the missing jekyll-sitemap in gem. You simply need to run this command to make this error goes away,

```
gem install jekyll-sitemap
```
