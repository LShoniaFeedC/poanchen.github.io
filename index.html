<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I am a software developer who is extremely passionate about building awesome web application or software. My goal is to make the world a better place with well-engineered software. As I am super excited about learning the latest trends in Software Development. In my spare time, I always tried to constantly learn new technologies to keep myself in the game. Recently, I decided to start writing blogs about some trending technologies that I have learned before and hopefully, people will learn a thing or two when reading it. If you would like to see my blog. Please go to <a href="/blog">here</a>. Enjoy! Also, check out my <a href="https://www.github.com/poanchen">GitHub</a> account to see what I have been working on.
