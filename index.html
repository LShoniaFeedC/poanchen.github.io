  <h1>Hi there, I'm Poan (Baron) Chen. You can call me Baron!</h1>
  <p>
    I am a developer who is extremely passionate about building awesome web application or software. My goal is to make the world a better place with well-engineered software. As I am super excited about learning the latest trends in Software Development. In my spare time, I always tried to constantly learn new technologies to keep myself in the game. Recently, I decided to start writing blogs about some trending technologies that I have learned before and hopefully, people will learn a thing or two when reading it. If you would like to see my blog. Please go to <a href="/blog">here</a>. Enjoy! Also, check out my GitHub account to see what I have been working on! <a href="https://www.github.com/poanchen">Poan (Baron) Chen GitHub account</a>
