        <title>The right way to manage nested callbacks</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In case you do not know what a callback is, please refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://husseinfaara.com/articles/what-the-heck-is-a-callback&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; awesome article by &lt;a href=&quot;https://husseinfaara.com/&quot;&gt;Hussein Faara&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All in all, callbacks are great. With callback, we are allowed to write code in JavaScript asynchronously and it just work. However, in real world, as a Software Engineer, we do not simply expect things to just work and be satisfied with it. We also look at other things. For example, maintainability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Let’s work with a real world example here to demonstrate what we want to talk about, say, we would like to add couple of songs to a...</description>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;This post talks about how one could get an interview with Microsoft for a Software Engineer role as well as its process. If you already got an interview with them, simply &lt;a href=&quot;#interview-process-at-microsoft&quot;&gt;skip&lt;/a&gt; to the part where I discuss its interview process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id=&quot;how-one-could-get-an-interview-with-microsoft-or-any-other-company-by-all-means&quot;&gt;How one could get an interview with Microsoft or any other company by all means&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\img\2019\05\20\How-to-get-an-interview-with-Microsoft-and-what-is-their-interview-process-like/Microsoft visit.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Me visiting Microsoft Redmond Campus&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As I have been interviewing with Microsoft for multiple times in the past three years, I feel I am somewhat qualify to talk about it.

        <title>How to calculate time complexity of an algorithm?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Knowing how fast your algorithm runs is extremely important. Often times, you will get asked to determine your algorithm performance in a big-O sense during interview. You will be expected to know how to calculate the time and space complexity of your code, sometimes you even need to explain how you get there. In some cases, it can be pretty tricky to get it right. In this article, I am going to show you guys how to do things right.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In most of the cases, you are going to see these kind of Big-O running time in your code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img...</description>

        <title>How to fix 'login must use security token' in Salesforce?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, I ran into this error message in Salesforce where it stated that &lt;strong&gt;“LOGIN_MUST_USE_SECURITY_TOKEN: Invalid username, password, security token; or user locked out. Are you at a new location? When accessing Salesforce–either via a desktop client or the API–from outside of your company’s trusted networks, you must add a security token to your password to log in. To get your new security token, log in to Salesforce. From your personal settings, enter Reset My Security Token in the Quick Find box, then select Reset My Security Token.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the official Salesforce documentation about &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api.meta/api/sforce_api_concepts_security.htm&quot;&gt;User Authentication&lt;/a&gt;, there are two...</description>

        <title>How to set up GPG key on GitHub?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Setting up GPG keys on GitHub is important because it allows other to know that you made the commit and not someone else. You, the person with your GitHub profile picture along with your GitHub username and name. Here is an example of a signing commit looks like on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2018/03/23/how-to-set-up-gpg-key-in-github/signing commit sample.png&quot; alt=&quot;signing commit sample&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2016-04-05-gpg-signature-verification/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; from GitHub mentioned, unlike any other unsigned commit. The signed commit will come with the green word &lt;em&gt;Verified&lt;/em&gt; with it (a badge) to indicate that the commit was indeed came from the user.
