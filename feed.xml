        <title>How to set up GPG key on GitHub?</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Setting up GPG keys on GitHub is important because it allows other to know that you made the commit and not someone else.

Here is an example of a signing commit looks like on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/2018/03/23/how-to-set-up-gpg-key-in-github/signing commit sample.png&quot; alt=&quot;signing commit sample&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.github.com/2016-04-05-gpg-signature-verification/&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; from GitHub mentioned, unlike any other unsigned commit.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I started my journey in answering people’s questions on Quora for about half a year now. Quora allows me to learn valuable things from other quorans. The plateform also gives me a place to share my technical knowledges to others. So far, I have answered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/PoAn-Baron-Chen-1&quot;&gt;99 questions&lt;/a&gt; on Quora. Most questions are technical with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.quora.com/profile/PoAn-Baron-Chen-1/topics&quot;&gt;wide variety of topics&lt;/a&gt;, such as Web Development, JavaScript, Software Engineering, Computer Science, Java, Algorithms, and Technology.

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Just like this great &lt;a href=&quot;http://marsology.blogspot.ca/2011/09/installing-marsyas-with-python-bindings.html&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; stated that “Combining the Marsyas python bindings with the matplotlib library for plotting in Python creates a great environment for prototyping. In the past few months I have done a lot of Marsyas work using this approach and really enjoy it. It gives a lot of the expressive power and prototyping of MATLAB while retaining the data-flow model and efficient processing of Marsyas. Unfortunately getting everything installed and setup for the first time takes some effort.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The article was really helpful as it gave a lot of pointer on how one can set up...</description>
