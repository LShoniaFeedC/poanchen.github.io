Ever wanted to create a pull request in GitHub but only wished to commit changes that is relevant? You are in luck. In this tutorial, I am going to show you how I would do it. Recently, I tried to create a pull request in GitHub and this is what I see.

The problem that I have here is that I only wanted to create a pull request with only the **a51afa6** and **07f39f7**. But, it seems like you cannot really do anything on the GitHub UI to remove it. You know why? Because you are not suppose to. You are suppose to create a branch with the latest changes and cherry-pick the ones that you want. And then compare that branch with the repository that you would like to contribute. The differences will only be the ones that you cherry-picked. Then, you are done. This is how you would create a GitHub pull request with a specific commits. Let me show you in action.

First, you need to create a branch with the latest changes (that is the same with the upstream remote branch)
{% highlight bash %}
  git fetch --all
  git checkout -b new-branch-name upstream/master
{% endhighlight %}

Note: The above assumes you've set up upstream as a remote. If not, do this first:
{% highlight bash %}
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/upstream_github_username/upstream_github_repo_name.git
{% endhighlight %}

Next, you would need to cherry-pick the changes that you would like to include in the pull request.
{% highlight bash %}
  git cherry-pick a51afa6
  git cherry-pick 07f39f7
{% endhighlight %}

Now, all you need to do is to push your changes to your GitHub repository
{% highlight bash %}
  git push -u origin new-branch-name
{% endhighlight %}

Head over to your GitHub repository, and you should see this.

Simply click **Compare & pull request** to create a pull request in the repository that you would like to contribute with only the changes you picked.

Tada. You have done it=)
