Have you ever seen this error message 
{% highlight bash %}
  error This file requires compiler and library support for the ISO C++ 2011 standard. This support is currently experimental, and must be enabled with the -std=c++11 or -std=gnu++11 compiler options.
{% endhighlight %}
before when you are running
{% highlight bash %}
  cmake CMakeLists.txt
{% endhighlight %}
command in a C++ project?

You are in luck. In this short tutorial, we are going to show you guys how to solve this issue.

You simply need to add the following line of code into your CMakeLists.txt file and it should works now.
{% highlight cmake %}
  SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "-std=c++11 -O3")
{% endhighlight %}

Tada. Your project should build successfully now =)
