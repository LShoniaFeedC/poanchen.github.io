A typical package.json looks something like this,

{% highlight JSON %}

  "name": "poanchen.github.io",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Data for poanchen.github.io. Blog and pages generated by Jekyll. Hosted on GitHub. https://poanchen.github.io",

We have recently made changes to package.json so, that is why the version of the library is up to update as of early April in 2020. Notice that the little symbol in front of each versioning. Namely the ^ and ~ (you might not see this symbol in this particular package.json but it is very common)

Here is their definition:

Using the ^ or carat (aka hat) symbol, means to

> include everything greater than a particular version in the same **major** range

For example, "gulp": "^3.0.1" would mean to inlcude everything from 3.0.1 (including) up to its next major version 4.0.0 (excluding).

Using the ~ or tilde symbol, means to

> include everything greater than a particular version in the same **minor** range

For example, "gulp": "~3.9.0" would mean to inlcude everything from 3.9.0 (including) up to its next minor version 3.10.0 (excluding).
<img src="/img/2020/04/12/what-is-the-difference-between-~-and-^-in-package-json/gulp ~3.9.0 semver npmjs.JPG" alt="gulp ~3.9.0 example">
